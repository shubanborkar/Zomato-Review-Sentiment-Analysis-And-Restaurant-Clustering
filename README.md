# Zomato Review Sentiment Analysis and Restaurant Clustering

## Project Overview

This project analyzes customer reviews from Zomato to extract sentiment insights and clusters restaurants based on various features such as location, cuisine, ratings, and sentiment scores. The goal is to understand customer satisfaction trends and identify meaningful groups of restaurants for better business insights and recommendations.

## Features

- Data preprocessing and cleaning for text reviews and restaurant metadata
- Sentiment analysis using NLP techniques
- Visualization of sentiment distribution across cuisines and locations
- Clustering restaurants with K-Means algorithm
- Interactive charts and detailed reports summarizing findings

## Dataset

This dataset contains comprehensive restaurant and review information designed for restaurant recommendation and analysis systems. The restaurant data includes essential business details such as restaurant names, web links, estimated per-person dining costs, and cuisine types served. Additionally, it captures operational information like restaurant timings and collection tags that align with popular food delivery platforms like Zomato categories.

The review data provides rich user-generated content with reviewer names, detailed review text, and numerical ratings. Each review entry includes valuable metadata such as the reviewer's profile information (number of reviews written and followers), timestamps indicating when reviews were posted, and the count of pictures accompanying each review. This dual-table structure enables comprehensive analysis of both restaurant characteristics and customer sentiment, making it suitable for building recommendation engines, performing sentiment analysis, or conducting market research on dining preferences and restaurant performance metrics.
