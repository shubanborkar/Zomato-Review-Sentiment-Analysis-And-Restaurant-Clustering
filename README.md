# Zomato Review Sentiment Analysis and Restaurant Clustering

## Project Overview

This project analyzes customer reviews from Zomato to extract sentiment insights and clusters restaurants based on various features such as location, cuisine, ratings, and sentiment scores. The goal is to understand customer satisfaction trends and identify meaningful groups of restaurants for better business insights and recommendations.

## Features

- Data preprocessing and cleaning for text reviews and restaurant metadata
- Sentiment analysis using NLP techniques (lexicon-based or ML-based)
- Visualization of sentiment distribution across cuisines and locations
- Clustering restaurants with algorithms like K-Means and Hierarchical Clustering
- Interactive charts and detailed reports summarizing findings

## Dataset

The dataset contains Zomato restaurant details and user reviews collected from [source/link]. It includes:

- Restaurant information: name, location, cuisine type, average rating, price range, etc.
- Customer reviews and ratings

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/zomato-review-sentiment-clustering.git
   cd zomato-review-sentiment-clustering
````

2. Create a virtual environment and activate it (optional but recommended):

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # Linux/Mac
   venv\Scripts\activate     # Windows
   ```

3. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

* Explore data and visualizations in the `notebooks/` folder.
* Run sentiment analysis and clustering scripts located in the `src/` folder:

  ```bash
  python src/sentiment_analysis.py
  python src/clustering.py
  ```
* Check the `reports/` directory for generated charts and summaries.

If you want, I can help you generate the initial Python script for sentiment analysis or clustering next. Would you like that?
